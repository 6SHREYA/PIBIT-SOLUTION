## Resume-to-JSON Converter
This project aims to automate the conversion of resume text into structured JSON format using OpenAI's ChatGPT prompt. By leveraging natural language processing capabilities, the system extracts key sections such as personal information, summary, education, skills, work experience, projects, certifications, and more from a resume text.

## Features
Automated Parsing: Converts unstructured resume text into structured JSON data.

Section Extraction: Identifies and categorizes sections like Personal Information, Summary, Education, Skills, Work Experience, Projects, Certifications, etc.

Maintained Formatting: Preserves original formatting of dates, job titles, and specific details as much as possible.
Customizable: Extendable for different resume formats and additional sections.

## How It Works
The system utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model to process resume text provided through a prompt. It analyzes the content, identifies key sections, and structures the information into JSON format according to predefined guidelines.

## Usage
